## Task
This project aims to create an API for managing and accessing data related to players
in Europe's top 5 football leagues. It provides endpoints to retrieve player information,
create new players, update existing player data, and delete players.

## Description
The API allows users to retrieve detailed information about players,
including their name, age, nationality, position, club, etc.
Users can paginate through the player data to access a specific subset of players.
The API also supports creating new players, updating player information,
and deleting players from the database.
